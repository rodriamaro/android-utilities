Code Style
----------

The rules below are not guidelines or recommendations, but strict
rules.

Not all existing code follows these rules, but all new code is expected to.

These rules are based upon "Android Code Style Guidelines"¹ (which are in turn
based upon "Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language"²). Please read
them accounting for the following exceptions/integrations:



Import ordering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ordering of import statements is:

* java and javax (core libraries)
* Android imports (core platform libraries)
* Imports from third parties (co, com, junit, net, org)
* Local imports (i.e.: coming from below the current application package root)

To exactly match the IDE settings, the imports should be:

* Alphabetical within each grouping.
* Capital letters are considered to come before lower case letter (e.g. Z before a).
* There should be a blank line between each major grouping (android, java, javax, com, junit, net,
  org).
  
Please avoid static imports.



Variable declaration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Always declare (but DO NOT INITIALIZE) all variables you intend to use at the
beginning of the block.

The same applies to instance variables, which are declared and then initialized
in constructors.

Only static and final variables can be declared and initialized at the same
time.

This style resembles Pascal "var" section or Haskell's "where". It is also used
throughout Apple's XNU code-base.
